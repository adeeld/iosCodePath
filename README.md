## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

None.

An app I want to build is Whats The Wave. It would be an app for Gen Z to easily make waves with their friends. For example, creating groups within it and adding different type of activities, food places to try, etc. A cool feature to add would be streaks like in Snapchat and Duolingo, but in this case, it the longer someone continues to go to waves and doesnt leave last second, the longer the streak. Adding a leaderboard on top of that which shows the person who least likely would chalk a wave the most would be cool as well.
